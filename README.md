# React_Pagination

Pagination using React hooks and axios

Google Branch will display only 8 pages as well as the previous, next, first and last page. When page turns to current page, the color will change to red. This is the mimic of google style: only show the current page and the front and end pages around current page. The difference is google allow 10 pages to appear, while this app only allow 8 pages to show.

Suitable for many pages in pagination application.

Originally consider the implementation of Ellipses, but it will totally change the current code structure, so decide to use google style, which is more feasiable.
